     UIManager has a function "ButtonPressed" that listens to all the UI button click events. It takes a string as a parameter that is used to differentiate the              functionality of a button. The flow of the menus as as follows:
     Upon starting/launching the game, the very first screen visible to the user will be the main menus screen. It has 1 play button. On clicking the play button the          Gameplay screen gets enabled, where the user will see his character and zombies. The top right cover contains the distance tab, players current distance travelled        will appear there. On the top left corner of the gameplay screen is a pause button. On clicking the pause button, pause screen appears that contains two buttons:        The resume button that takes player back to the gameplay screen and the end button that takes player to the main menu screen and quit the game.
