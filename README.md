added UIManager.cs script that is used to manage all game menus and UI related jobs, currently added 3 menus (main menue, game play, pause menu).                        UIManager has a function "ButtonPressed" that listens to all the UI button click events. It takes a string as a parameter that is used to differentiate the              functionality of a button. The flow of the menus as as follows:
Upon starting/launching the game, the very first screen visible to the user will be the main menus screen. It has 1 play button. On clicking the play button the          Gameplay screen gets enabled, where the user will see his character and zombies. The top right cover contains the distance tab, players current distance travelled        will appear there. On the top left corner of the gameplay screen is a pause button. On clicking the pause button, pause screen appears that contains two buttons:        The resume button that takes player back to the gameplay screen and the end button that takes player to the main menu screen and quit the game. (19 hours)
     
     
# week 6
Added forest environment. Implemented EnvironmentSpawner.cs script responsible to spawn forest prefabs once the player reaches the midpoint of the current forest prefab. This is made to give players a feel of an infinite environment. The midpoint of the environment is detected through Checkpoint.cs script. A gameobject with a box collider of trigger type has checkpoint script attached with it. Whenever the player gets into the trigger of this collider, it calls the environmentspawner to destroy the previous forest and randomly spawn the new forest out of 3 in front of the current forest.(9 hours)

# week 7
Integrated PlayerController.cs script responsible to move the player in the game. Player always moves forward in the environment at a constant speed (Can change depending upon the distance covered to keep up the difficulty). Player's basic animator controller was added with Idle, run, and death animations. Player controller has an Update function that moves the player. The movement starts when the user clicks the play button. Player can be paused by clicking the pause button and resuming to move again.
Added player right and left movements on pressing 'A' and 'D' key respectively. We faced a bug were the character would go off the paths if we keep pressing left or right. The bug was in the values(10 hours)

# week 8 
Added ZombiesSpawner.cs and ZombieController.cs. ZombiesSpawner is responsible for spawning zombies randomly in the lanes. Spawner instantiates 2 types of zombies, 1 remains idle while the other walks forward. Both types of zombies can attack the player once he comes in range. Both zombies has their own animators. Their gameobject has a box collider of trigger type attached and a rigidbody and ZombieController to control the AI. The damage and speed of the zombies can be set in the inspector. Also, the type of zombie is to be set in the inspector. Currently, we have 2 types so 0 and 1 index is used. 0 is for the idle zombie while 1 is for walking. The Player's health is also integrated and the game ends when the player dies. (8 hours)

#week 9

we didnt made any progress this week due to busy schedule.

#week 10
   Added zombies and player textures. fixed a couple of bugs that we faced after the previous changes. such as:
     Zombie movement through the game pause screen is fixed. Zombie keeps on moving behind the pause screen, while the player was stopped before. (7 hours)
     
 #week 11
    Integrated bullets system. Spawning bullets with the desired firerate according to the gun player has. We can set the firerate in Utilities.cs with 2 constant floats named as PistolFireRate, SMGFireRate for pistol, and smg accordingly. The firerate is the the delay between each bullet fired if the user press and holds Up/W key. A bullet prefab is created in Prefabs/Weapons folder, this prefab gets spawned depending upon the input and firerate. The speed of the bullet can be set in the inspector view of the bullet prefab. The prefab hasCollisionEnter fuction that listens to the bullet hit. If a zombie comes in collision with the bullet, it destroys the bullet and play's the kill animation of the zombie. (9 hours)
